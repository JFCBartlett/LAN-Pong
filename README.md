This was a project I was working on as a challenge to be able to learn how the sockets library in python works.
It is currently not functional and probably won't be as what is currently needed to be modified for the game to work is changing a varible from a tuple to a list.
It will not be worth my time to make these modifications to the program as I will not learn anything more useful by changing this.
